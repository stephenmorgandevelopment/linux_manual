# linux_manual
Use your phone or table to search through linux man pages.  Search by command name or description.  Syncs directly from the Ubuntu man pages repository.

Under initial development.  Only got started really.  Came up with the idea a few days ago, and put in a solid couple days work now.

Planning on finishing the RxJava / Retrofit side of this next week.
