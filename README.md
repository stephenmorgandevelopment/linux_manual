# linux_manual

Use your phone or table to search through linux man pages. Search by command name or description.
Syncs directly from the Ubuntu man pages repository.

In working release condition. Please advise of any issues.

Greatly modernized to use Kotlin and Coroutines, very little legacy Java code remaining.

Will be submitting to google play store shortly.  
I may need to change the package name (namespace) as I am not sure if I
still have the signing key used to publish the original app.
